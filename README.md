# TreasureMapsPlus

This plugin provides a solution to the lag spikes that are caused by treasure maps searching for a location to put on a map. This plugin just makes those maps provide the loot table when you right click with the map in your hand.

Currently, it only supports map generated in chests from vanilla loot tables, but I plan to add support for maps from villager trading as well.

## Build
`./gradlew build`
